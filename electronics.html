                    High demands are put on the electronics if atomic resolution is to be established. A reliable
                    feedback controller and a high resolution actuating system is of high importance in order to scan
                    the sample with good accuracy.
                </p>

            <div class="well" id="scanner">
                <h3><b>Scanner</b></h3>
                <p>To control the tip, we use a piezo element divided into four quadrants (see <a href="overview.html">overview</a>).
                    Each quadrant is
                    connected to a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC), while the brass piece of the piezo is connected to
                    ground (in this case, the body of the microscope). By applying voltages to the quadrants, we can
                    scan the tip. The more accurately we can apply a voltage, the higher our resolution will be. In his
                    home-built STM, Dan Berard claims the to achieve atomic resolution, the DACs used have to have a
                    resolution of at least 20 bit. Therefore, we used four <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/dac1220.pdf">Texas Instrument DAC1220E</a>, a 20 bit, high precision DAC. The DACs are by far the most expensive part of the
                    microscope. At first, we tried to use a breadboard to connect the DACs. However, the output signal
                    was very unstable and noisy, probably due to all the stray capacitance in the breadboard, which
                    causes more capacitive coupling. Because of this, we had to design and order a <a href="https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/XQKkLpe6">printed circuit board</a>
                    (PCB). The PCB was designed in the open-source program KiCAD and followed the
                    design recommendations found in the DAC’s datasheet. The DACs were controlled by the Arduino using
                    what is called Serial Peripheral Interface, or SPI for short. The PCB with and without components
                    can be seen in <a href="#fig1">figure 1</a>.

            <div class="well" id="amplification">
                <h3><b>Amplification system</b></h3>
                <p>To amplify the tunneling current, which is on the order of nanoampere or less, we used the op amp
                    Texas Instrument OPA637, configured as a transimpedance amplifier (current to voltage), see <a
                            href="#fig2">figure
                        2</a>. The parts were assembled on a PCB, designed by <a href="#">Dan Berard</a>. The most
                    important
                    characteristic when choosing an op amp for this kind of application is the input bias current, which
                    tells you how much the op amp diverges from one of the rules for an ideal op amp; that no current
                    flows into the op amp’s input. In other words, it tells you how much current the amplifier will
                    “steal” from the tunneling current. The OPA637 has an input bias current in the order of 1
                    picoampere, which is extremely low. So if, for instance, if we have a tunneling current of 1 nA, 1
                    pA will be lost to the negative input pin of the amplifier, while the rest, 0,999 nA will be forced
                    through the 100 MΩ seen in figure x, causing a voltage drop of 99,9 mV, which we then can measure.
                    To measure the voltage, we use the Arduino’s built-in Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), which has a
                    resolution of 12 bit. The minimize the noise, the amplifier is placed in a grounded metal cage and
                    we use a coaxial cable between the sample and the amplifier.
                </p>

                <figure class="centerimage" id="fig2">
                    <img src="images/op_amp.jpg" class="centerfigure img-responsive">
                    <figcaption class="centertext"><i>Figure 2: transimpedance amplifier</i></figcaption>
                    <br>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    Since we use a positive bias on the the tip and the amplifier is connected to the sample, the
                    current will flow towards the amplifier’s negative input which is virtual ground, causing a negative
                    output voltage. However, the Arduino can only measure voltages between -0,5 V and 3,8 V, and
                    voltages outside this range could damage the input pin or even the whole board. To resolve this, we
                    used a regular op amp (in our case Texas Instruments LM324) in an inverting voltage-follower
                    configuration, see <a href="#fig3">figure 3</a>. We also used a 3,3 V Zener diode between the input
                    pin and ground to
                    protect the pin from over-voltages, since the amplifier is able to supply up to 15 V.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Given the huge amplification we are dealing with (108 V/A), measures had to be taken to reduce
                    noise. The amplifier was placed in an aluminium cage, which was wrapped i aluminium foil and
                    grounded. The cable used between the sample and the amplifier was a coaxial cable, with the outer
                    shielding layer grounded to minimize noise pick-up. It is also vital that the cable is made as short
                    as possible. When we tested the amplifier without these measures, the 50 Hz noise coming from all
                    the power cables caused so much noise that the amplifier reached its maximum value of 15 Vpk.
                    However, after our efforts, the noise was less than 200 mVppk, a value we were very pleased with.

                <h3><b>Tip bias</b></h3>
                <p>The tip bias does not have to be nearly as accurate, only stable, as the bias on the piezo.
                    Therefore, we could simply use our Arduino Zero’s built-in 10 bit DAC to set it. The Arduino can
                    only output voltages between 0 V and 3,3 V, hence we can only have a postive bias.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="well" id="stepper">
                <h3><b>Stepper motor</b></h3>
                <p>For coarse adjustment, we used a bipolar stepper motor with 4096 steps per revolution, see Mechanics.
                    The stepper motor is connected to an ar (datasheet), an IC module which consists of seven Darlington
                    transistors (although we only use four), transistors with high amplification that can handle high
                    voltages and currents. The ULN2003 is in turn connected to four digital outputs from the Arduino, so
                    that when when a voltage pulse is sent from one of the outputs to the ULN2003, the current is
                    amplified and passed to the motor. By sending voltages in the right order to the four electromagnets
                    in the motor, we can make it turn just the right amount of steps.
