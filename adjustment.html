                <h1>Coarse approach</h1>
                <p> In order to establish a tunneling current, the sample has to be approached into a nanometer proximity to the probe. A reliable way of approaching the specimen without breaking the tip is thus the first step that must be overcome in order to achieve a functioning microscope </p>

            <div class="well" id="coarse">
                <h3><b>Coarse approach</b></h3>
                <p>One of the most important aspects of an STM is the coarse approach, i.e. how the microscope closes the relative long distance between the sample and the tip after the sample is placed in the microscope in order to achieve a tunneling current.</p>
                <p>One option for coarse approach that had us intrigued early on was what is called the stick-slip technique. Stick-slip is most easily explained with an example: image that you have a piece of paper. In the middle of that paper you place something rather heavy, say for instance your wallet. If you then push the paper ahead of you slowly, the wallet will, due to friction, stay put on the same position on paper. But if you then pull the paper back quickly, the force will overcome the friction and the wallet will have moved from its original position! This technique can be used to move either the sample or the tip with, in theory, very high precision. A slider can be created by taking two slightly different weighted masses, attaching a Piezo buzzer to one and fastening the other to the piezo via a small rod. By then applying a sawtooth-shaped voltage signal to a piezo buzzer, which will expand slowly and retract quickly, you can make the slider move. During the slow expansion, only the inertia of the lighter mass will be overcome, moving it away from the buzzer. When the buzzer retracts rapidly, both masses inertia will be overcome, and the slider will have moved one step in the direction of the lighter mass. Careful controlling of the amplitude and frequency of the sawtooth signal will in theory give a shortest step distance on the nanometer scale.</p>
                <p>However, during our testing, it proved hard to construct a reliable approach mechanism based on this method, and given the scope of the problem itself, would perhaps be suited for a project in itself.</p>
                <p>Following the rejection of the stick-slip motor, we chose a more conventional technique for the coarse approach: a stepper motor. This coarse approach method meant placing placing the sample on the end of a high thread count screw, and slowly screwing it towards the tip proved more reliable and easily implemented. We used a screw taken from a micrometer (the measuring tool, not the unit) where one rotation would move the sample half a millimeter forward. By controlling this with a stepper motor with 4096 steps per rotation, we achieved a lowest possible resolution of around 125 nanometres per motor step. In practise the resolution is lower, due to looseness in the motor and screw fastening, but still more than enough for this application.</p>
